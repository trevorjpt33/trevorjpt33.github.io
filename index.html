        <h2>Good design example #1: Harrys.com</h2>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/exAldp6.png" alt="Harry's homepage">  
        <p>When you first load up the homepage of the website for Harry's Razors, the above picture is what you see.  
            A fairly minimalistic design with sets of products being grouped into large tiles. The colors chosen are
            pleasing to the eye and grab your attention, yet they are not overbearing nor do they overshadow the 
            minimalistic design choices.  Overall, the design is smooth and seamless.  As the user, I enjoy navigating
            their site.  After visiting their site, I would consider myself more likely to be interested in the product.

        <h2>Good design example #2: Nintendo Switch Lite</h2>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gPtvz1H.jpg" alt="Nintendo Switch front">
        <p>For many people, the Nintendo brand is a household name, meaning they have been around for quite some time.  
            They have released quite a few successful products, and for that reason it might be tempting to try and 
            reinvent the wheel through some experimental or complex layout of the buttons or the screen.  With the new 
            Lite model of the Nintendo Switch, there are no extravagant folding screens or fancy tech.  It's just the 
            same simple, practical design that users of Nintendo have come to love over the years.  Like always, it's just
            two control sticks (one on each side), the directional pad, and the diamond layout of the other 4 buttons.  This 
            simple and easy-to-use button layout surrounds an extra wide screen to make the gamer feel as immersed as possible.  
            All of this comes in an even lighter, slimmer, more portable design.
