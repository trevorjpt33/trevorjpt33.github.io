        <h2>Good design example #1: Harrys.com</h2>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/exAldp6.png" alt="Harry's homepage">  
        <p>When you first load up the homepage of the website for Harry's Razors, the above picture is what you see.  
            A fairly minimalistic design with sets of products being grouped into large tiles. The colors chosen are
            pleasing to the eye and grab your attention, yet they are not overbearing nor do they overshadow the 
            minimalistic design choices.  Overall, the design is smooth and seamless.  As the user, I enjoy navigating
            their site.  After visiting their site, I would consider myself more likely to be interested in the product.

        <h2>Good design example #2: Nintendo Switch Lite</h2>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gPtvz1H.jpg" alt="Nintendo Switch front">
        <p>For many people, the Nintendo brand is a household name, meaning they have been around for quite some time.  
            They have released quite a few successful products, and for that reason it might be tempting to try and 
            reinvent the wheel through some experimental or complex layout of the buttons or the screen.  With the new 
            Lite model of the Nintendo Switch, there are no extravagant folding screens or fancy tech.  It's just the 
            same simple, practical design that users of Nintendo have come to love over the years.  Like always, it's just
            two control sticks (one on each side), the directional pad, and the diamond layout of the other 4 buttons.  This 
            simple and easy-to-use button layout surrounds an extra wide screen to make the gamer feel as immersed as possible.  
            All of this comes in an even lighter, slimmer, more portable design.

        <h2>Bad design example #1: Art.yale.edu</h2>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/zNLJgSF.png" alt="Yale Art homepage">
        <p>If you look at the picture above (the homepage), you likely will not need much convincing that it is objectively 
            bad design.  First of all, you can see the dreaded repeating, low quality image in the bakcgound.  Except it's not 
            just a low quality image.  It's actually an animation that plays in each individual copy of the image that is scattered
            all across the background.  I immediately felt overstimulated when I navigated to this website and it was difficult to
            focus on any of the text or links in the actual foreground of the page.  When it comes to the foreground, there is no real 
            thought put into the colors and how they blend together.  One box is a gradient yellow, one is orange, the other is blue.  
            Furthermore, the layout in general is very disjointed and hard to follow and it looks like all the elements of the site are 
            just patched in there.  I did not enjoy my experience browsing this website and have no desire to do so again.

        <h2>Bad design example #2: Microsoft Surface Duo</h2>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/V1bGcWA.jpg" alt="Duo unfolded view">
        <p>At a first glance, the design of the Microsoft Surface duo looks quite appealing.  However, for what it has in aesthetics, it 
            lacks in practical uses and software design.  It folds up neatly and features two separate screens that can also switch 
            to form one large display.  This can come in handy for reading or multitasking by having two different applications open at once.  
            But when it comes to video conferencing and capturing photos, it's not so practical.  And even when attempting to utilize the two screens, 
            switching windows from one screen to another is laggy and both screens aren't always in sync.  According to many users, it is simply just a pain.
            Especially in the current times where many companies and academic institutions rely on Zoom calls and virtual meetings for daily tasks.  
            Those same tools are often how we interact with loved ones as well.  This can prove to be difficult since between the two screens there is just one camera.  
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0e7Tdmk.jpg" alt="Duo upright view">
            Resting the phone to attend a virtual meeting is a bit confusing. It is nearly impossible to 
            achieve the perfect angle where your camera captures your face and you can also see other people clearly.  Some have attempted to fold it like 
            a laptop, some stand it upright like a book (see pcture above), and some just hold it.  None of those options are comfortable though.  The toughest 
            part of all of this is that the camera quality is poor, which makes it not worth the trouble.  Coming in at about 8MP, many users aren't satisfied 
            with the camera to begin with.  Lastly, there is a bar that separates the two screens, which cuts out part of the picture when viewing in tablet mode.
            Essentially just drawing attention to the fact that it's two separate screens and not one large screen. Many users found themselves enthralled with how the phone looks 
            in the beginning, but now find themselves dissatisfied with the usability and unhappy with their purchase.
